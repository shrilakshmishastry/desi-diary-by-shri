# Welcome to My Blog

Hello everyone! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences about frontend development,
accessibility, and open source contributions.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be covering:

- React and modern frontend development
- Web accessibility best practices
- Open source contributions and learnings
- Technical tutorials and guides

## Code Examples

Here's a simple example of an accessible button component:

```tsx
const Button = ({ children, onClick, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      className="px-4 py-2 rounded bg-blue-600 text-white"
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

Stay tuned for more posts!
